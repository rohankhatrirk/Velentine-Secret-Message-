          Queen ðŸ’–,
          <br />
          I want to promise you that there will be no day of your life when you
          will not find me by your side. There will be no day when I will not be
          loving you and pampering you because you mean the world to me. You are
          my inspiration; you make me want to be the best for you because you
          are the best for me. I am so delighted and glad, and I am filled with
          joy to be called your man â€” in other words, Iâ€™m satisfied. I love you,
          my babyðŸ¤ž. I will adore every bit of you because you deserve
          everything
        </p>
        <p>Missing You A Lot ðŸ¤žðŸ’–</p>
